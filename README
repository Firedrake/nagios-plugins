:check_ssl-cert

This is the SSL equivalent of check_tcp; it checks a TCP port (IPv4
only) to make sure (a) it can establish an SSL connection and (b) that
the certificate presented is valid. Ports 25, 110 and 143 will be
handled with the STARTTLS procedures appropriate to those protocols;
other ports (e.g. 443) will attempt a direct SSL connection. (This is
usually the right thing to do.)

Parameters:

-c, -w - number of days to generate WARNING/CRITICAL before expiry of
any certificate in the chain. (An expired or not-yet-valid certificate
is always CRITICAL.)

-H - the host's name or IP address.

-p - the port.

-n - the name of the certificate the host should present.

-C - the path to the certificate repository.

If you have no certificate repository, omit the -n parameter and no
chain verification will be attempted - the plugin will still confirm
that an unverified SSL connection is possible, though this isn't
terribly useful.


:check_alldisks_ide_smart

Intended to be run via NRPE; looks down /dev/disk/by-id and runs
check_ide_smart on each distinct entry that starts with ata- or scsi-,
then returns a summary result.
