check_ssl-cert

Checks a TCP port (IPv4 only) for SSL. Ports 25, 110 and 143 will be
handled with the STARTTLS procedures appropriate to those protocols;
other ports (e.g. 443) will attempt a direct SSL connection. (This is
usually the right thing to do.)

Parameters:

-c, -w - number of days to generated WARNING/CRITICAL before expiry of
any certificate in the chain. (An expired or not-yet-valid certificate
is always CRITICAL.)

-H - the host's name or IP address.

-p - the port.

-n - the name of the certificate the host should present.

-C - the path to the certificate repository.

If you have no certificate repository, omit the -n parameter and no
chain verification will be attempted - the plugin will still confirm
that an unverified SSL connection is possible and the right certificate
is presented.
